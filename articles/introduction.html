												<h1><a href="../index.html">Introduction to Residential
                                                Construction Management</a></h1>
												<p>A field manual for site managers</p>
											</header>
											<p>We are looking at infrastructure management or infrastructure creation as integral to the development process, especially in countries like New Zealand. Whether it is the design and construction of houses, multi unit properties, or commercial buildings, this infrastructure is required to achieve any kind of development. Large scale management is involved in many of these developments, for example multi site management, multi unit development, or multi storey commercial development.</p>
<p>You must remember that every construction project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is unique, in terms of local conditions, the people and equipment involved in the construction, and the quality of materials.</li> 
<li>Involves a huge commitment of resources like labour, materials, equipment, finance, and time.</li> 
</ul> 

<p>These project can span several months or over several years, from the start of the project someone has to plan what kind of resources, for example, what kind of equipment will be needed at different point in time as the project progresses. What kind of labour will be required at different points in time? What kind of materials will be needed at different stages? What kind of cashflow is needed at different stages?</p>

<p>We can look at costs on a micro scale like hourly labour costs or look at the whole picture like
a daily labour cost to see how much a project will cost.</p>

<p>This require a planning or foresight into how the project will flow. This 
sort of though is an integral part of a Construction Management Plan.</p>

                                            <header>
												<h3>What is Construction Management?</h3>
											</header>
<p>Construction management (CM) is a professional service that uses specialized, project management techniques to oversee the planning, design, and construction of a project, from its beginning to its end. The purpose of CM is to control a project's time / delivery, cost and qualityâ€”sometimes referred to as a project management triangle or "triple constraints."[1] CM is compatible with all project delivery systems, including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings (commercial real estate, transportation infrastructure, industrial facilities, and military infrastructure), called capital projects.</p>


                                            <header>
												<h3>What is a Project?</h3>
											</header>
<ul>
<li>A project is <b>temporary</b></li> 
<li>It has a definite start and end date</li> 
<li>Thereby having a defined <b>scope</b> and <b>resources</b></li> 
</ul> 


 
<p>A project is also <b>unique</b></p>

<ul> 
<li>It is not a everyday operational work with repetitive output.</li> 
<li>It is a specific set of activities to accomplish a well defined unique objective</li> 
</ul> 




<p>A project is is temporary, it is a specific, there is only so much you can accomplish between the
beginning of a project and the end of it, because of this we need to manage the resources and
labour in a way that maximizes the amount of work we are able to achieve.</p> 

<p>A project is unique in the sense that it is different from the normal processes and sub-processes
involved in everyday work, it has well defined activities and definitive goals.</p>

<p>Some of the most recognizable construction projects are the Giza Pyramids, The Great Wall of
China, The Taj Mahal, The Empire State Building.</p>



                                            <header>
												<h3>Types of Construction</h3>
											</header>
<ul>
<li><b>Agricultural:</b> Typically economical buildings, and other improvements, for agricultural purposes. Examples include barns, equipment and animal sheds, specialized fencing, storage silos and elevators, and water supply and drains such as wells, tanks, and ditches.</li> 
<li><b>Residential:</b> Residential construction includes houses, apartments, townhouses, and other smaller, low-rise housing, small office types.[2]</li> 
<li><b>Commercial:</b> This refers to construction for the needs of private commerce, trade, and services. Examples include office buildings, "big box" stores, shopping centers and malls, warehouses, banks, theaters, casinos, resorts, golf courses, and larger residential structures such as high-rise hotels and condominiums.</li> 
<li><b>Institutional:</b> This category is for the needs of government and other public organizations. Examples include schools, fire and police stations, libraries, museums, dormitories, research buildings, hospitals, transportation terminals, some military facilities, and governmental buildings.</li> 
<li>Industrial: Buildings and other constructed items used for storage and product production, including chemical and power plants, steel mills, oil refineries and platforms, manufacturing plants, pipelines, and seaports.</li> 
<li><b>Heavy civil:</b> The construction of transportation infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railroads, tunnels, airports, and fortified military facilities.[2] Dams are also included, but most other water-related infrastructure is considered environmental.</li> 
<li><b>Environmental:</b> Environmental construction was part of heavy civil, but is now separate, dealing with projects that improve the environment. Some examples are water and wastewater treatment plants, sanitary and storm sewers, solid waste management, and air pollution control.[2]</li> 
</ul> 




                                            <header>
												<h3>Stakeholders of a Construction Project</h3>
											</header>
<p>Every project has a number of people involved in it, they are called stakeholders, in
construction management they can be viewed as resource to be allocated to various stages of the
project.</p> 

                                            <header>
												<h4><b>Client</b></h4>
											</header>
    
<p>The client is essentially the owner of the facility, the client does not necessarily have to
have experience with any part of the construction process and so will engage a designer.</p>


                                            <header>
												<h4><b>Designer</b></h4>
											</header>
<p>The design could be functional, it could be aesthetic, it could be structural.</p>

                                            <header>
												<h4><b>Contractors</b></h4>
											</header>

<p>The contractor is the agency which carries out the work, they execute the project or construct
the project. Contractors are assigned to a construction project during the design or once the design
has been completed by a licensed architect or a licensed civil engineer. This is done by going
through a bidding process with different contractors. The contractor is selected by using one of
three common selection methods: low-bid selection, best-value selection, or qualifications-based
selection.</p>

                                            <header>
												<h4><b>Investors</b></h4>
											</header>
    
<p>Investors have become an important part of a project. We often hear of the PPP model. by the
government, and have been redefined in order to have automatically wide margins in the main matter,
and narrow margins in the front and back matters. However, the page style can be changed at any
moment, even in the middle of the document.</p>

                                            <header>
												<h4><b>The Public</b></h4>
											</header>

<p>In large infrastructure projects the public must be kept in mind at all stages, while they may
not necessarily be consulted, it is they that will use the project and be subjected to various
disturbances during the construction of the project. In residential construction there can still be
significant disturbances to surrounding properties and it is vital to minimize these
disturbances.</p>


                                            <header>
												<h3>Obtaining the Construction Project</h3>
											</header>


                                            <header>
												<h4><b>Obtaining the Construction Project</b></h4>
											</header>

<p>A bid is given to the owner by construction managers that are willing to complete their
construction project. A bid tells the owner how much money they should expect to pay the
construction management company in order for them to complete the project.[2]</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Open bid:</b> An open bid is used for public projects. Any and all contractors are allowed to submit their bid due to public advertising.</li> 
<li><b>Closed bid:</b> A closed bid is used for private projects. A selection of contractors are sent an invitation for bid so only they can submit a bid for the specified project.[2]</li> 
<li></li> 
<li></li> 
</ul> 


                                            <header>
												<h4><b>Selection Methods</b></h4>
											</header>
<ul>
<li><b>Low-bid selection:</b> This selection focuses on the price of a project. Multiple construction management companies submit a bid to the owner that is the lowest amount they are willing to do the job for. Then the owner usually chooses the company with the lowest bid to complete the job for them.[2]</li> 
<li><b>Best-value selection:</b> This selection focuses on both the price and qualifications of the contractors submitting bids. This means that the owner chooses the contractor with the best price and the best qualifications. The owner decides by using a request for proposal (RFP), which provides the owner with the contractor's exact form of scheduling and budgeting that the contractor expects to use for the project.[2]</li> 
<li><b>Qualifications-based selection:</b> This selection is used when the owner decides to choose the contractor only on the basis of their qualifications. The owner then uses a request for qualifications (RFQ), which provides the owner with the contractor's experience, management plans, project organization, and budget and schedule performance. The owner may also ask for safety records and individual credentials of their members.[2] This method is most often used when the contractor is hired early during the design process so that the contractor can provide input and cost estimates as the design develops.</li> 
</ul> 

                                            <header>
												<h3>Payment Contracts</h3>
											</header>

<ul>
<li><b>Lump sum:</b> This is the most common type of contract. The construction manager and the owner agree on the overall cost of the construction project and the owner is responsible for paying that amount whether the construction project exceeds or falls below the agreed price of payment.[2]</li> 
<li><b>Cost plus fee:</b> This contract provides payment for the contractor including the total cost of the project as well as a fixed fee or percentage of the total cost. This contract is beneficial to the contractor since any additional costs will be paid for, even though they were unexpected for the owner.[2]</li> 
<li><b>{guaranteed maximum price:</b> This contract is the same as the cost-plus-fee contract although there is a set price that the overall cost and fee do not go above.[2]</li> 
<li><b>Unit price:</b> This contract is used when the cost cannot be determined ahead of time. The owner provides materials with a specific unit price to limit spending.[2]</li> 
</ul> 

                                            <header>
												<h3>Project Stages</h3>
											</header>
<p>Characteristics of construction project stages of various project management approaches[5]</p>

<p>The stages of a typical construction project have been defined as feasibility, design,
construction and operation,[5] each stage relating to the project life cycle.</p>

                                            <header>
												<h3>Feasibility and Design</h3>
											</header>

<p>Feasibility and design involves four steps: programming and feasibility, schematic design, design
development, and contract documents. It is the responsibility of the design team to ensure that the
design meets all building codes and regulations. It is during the design stage that the bidding
process takes place.[2]</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Conceptual/Programming and feasibility:</b> The needs, goals, and objectives must be determined for the building. Decisions must be made on the building size, number of rooms, how the space will be used, and who will be using the space. This must all be considered to begin the actual designing of the building. This phase is normally a written list of each room or space, the critical information about those spaces, and the approximate square footage of each area.</li> 
<li><b>Schematic design:</b> Schematic designs are sketches used to identify spaces, shapes, and patterns. Materials, sizes, colours, and textures must be considered in the sketches.[2] This phase usually involves developing the floor plan, elevations, a site plan, and possibly a few details.</li> 
<li>Design development (DD): This step requires research and investigation into what materials and equipment will be used as well as their cost. During this phase, the drawings are refined with information from structural, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical engineers. It also involves a more rigorous evaluation how the applicable building codes will impact the project.</li> 
<li><b>Contract documents (CDs):</b> Contract documents are the final drawings and specifications of the construction project. They are used by contractors to determine their bid while builders use them for the construction process. Contract documents can also be called working drawings.[2]</li> 
</ul> 


                                            <header>
												<h3>Pre-construction</h3>
											</header>

<p>The pre-construction stage begins when the owner gives a notice to proceed to the contractor that
they have chosen through the bidding process. A notice to proceed is when the owner gives permission
to the contractor to begin their work on the project. The first step is to assign the project team
which includes the project manager (PM), contract administrator, superintendent, and field
engineer.[2]</p>


<ul>
<li><b>Project manager:</b> The project manager is in charge of the project team.</li> 
<li><b>Contract administrator:</b> The contract administrator assists the project manager as well as the superintendent with the details of the construction contract.</li> 
<li><b>Superintendent:</b> It is the superintendent's job to make sure everything is on schedule including flow of materials, deliveries, and equipment. They are also in charge of coordinating on-site construction activities.[2]</li> 
<li><b>Field engineer:</b> A field engineer is considered an entry-level position and is responsible for paperwork.</li> 
</ul> 

<p>During the pre-construction stage, a site investigation must take place. A site investigation
takes place to discover if any steps need to be implemented on the job site. This is in order to get
the site ready before the actual construction begins. This also includes any unforeseen conditions
such as historical artifacts or environment problems. A soil test must be done to determine if the
soil is in good condition to be built upon.[2]</p>

                                            <header>
												<h3>Procurement</h3>
											</header>

<p>The procurement stage is when labour, materials and equipment needed to complete the project are
purchased. This can be done by the general contractor if the company does all their own construction
work. If the contractor does not do their own work, they obtain it through subcontractors.
Subcontractors are contractors who specialize in one particular aspect of the construction work such
as concrete, welding, glass, or carpentry. Subcontractors are hired the same way a general
contractor would be, which is through the bidding process. Purchase orders are also part of the
procurement stage.[2]</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Purchase orders:</b> A purchase order is used in various types of businesses. In this case, a purchase order is an agreement between a buyer and seller that the products purchased meet the required specifications for the agreed price.[2]</li> 
</ul>

<p>Trim off the wall underlay that is turned into the framed opening at the internal face of the
framing or turn it down or along the inside face of the framing and staple it (see Figure 1). Donâ€™t
cut it off part way across the sill trimmer or trimming stud as this makes achieving an effective
air seal much harder.</p>
Checking, stacking and storage
