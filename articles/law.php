												<h3>Contracts</h3>
											</header>
											<p>A contract has three main components - offer,
                                            acceptance and consideration(payment). All three are
                                            needed for a valid contract, in addition, the action
                                            being contracted for must be legal, and the parties have
                                            authority to contract, be of age and not be insane.</p>
                                            
                                            <p>Contracts can be written or verbal, and both are legally binding, but in practice, a verbal contract is generally much harder to enforce as it relies on people's memories and interpretations of what was said. Verbal contracts are best avoided.</p>

                                            <p>These project can span several months or over several years, from the start of the project someone has to plan what kind of resources, for example, what kind of equipment will be needed at different point in time as the project progresses. What kind of labour will be required at different points in time? What kind of materias will be needed at diferent stages? What kind of cashflow is needed at different stages?</p>

<p>The conract is equally binding on both parties and not owned by either side. Once signed, it is
subject to New Zealand law and can only be changed by agreement by both parties. Variations should
be made in writing. A building contraat is further bound by the Building Act 2004, which defines
many of the responsibilities and expectations of the contracting parties and includes some clauses
that cannot be contracted out of.</p>

<p>Contracts are a legal requirement for work with a value over $20,000</p>

												<h4><b>Full Contracts</b></h4>
											</header>
                                            <p>>In a full contract a builder in the main contractor
                                            with full responsibility until the point of handing over
                                            the finished project to the client. The builder hires
                                            subcontractors and manages the whole process, including
                                            purchasing materials and services.</p>

												<h4><b>Managed Labour Only Contracts</b></h4>
											</header>
                                            <p>A managed labour only contract has the builder
                                            managing the building site but not supplyinh materials
                                            or having contractual relationships with other
                                            contractors. The Client arranges supply of materials nd
                                            has individual contracts with the subcontractors who are
                                            supervised by the builder.</p>

												<h4><b>Labour Only Contracts</b></h4>
											</header>
                                            <p>The labour only contract is similar to the managed
                                            contract in that someone other than the builder assumes
                                            the roles and subsequent responsibilities of the main
                                            contractor.</p>

                                            <header>
												<h4><b>Charge Up or Cost Reimbursement Contracts</b></h4>
											</header>
                                            <p>Charge up or cost reimbursement contracts are where
                                            the client aggrees to the builder chargin up the actual
                                            ost of the job as the build progresses.</p>
<p>Construction management (CM) is a professional service that uses specialized, project management techniques to oversee the planning, design, and construction of a project, from its beginning to its end. The purpose of CM is to control a project's time / delivery, cost and qualityâ€”sometimes referred to as a project management triangle or "triple constraints."[1] CM is compatible with all project delivery systems, including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings (commercial real estate, transportation infrastructure, industrial facilities, and military infrastructure), called capital projects.</p>
