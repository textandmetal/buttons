											<p>We are looking at infrastructure management or infrasturcture creation as integral to the development process, especially in countries like New Zealand. Whether it is the design and construction of houses, multi unit properties, or commercial buildings, this infrastructure is required to achieve any kind of development. Large scale managenment is involved in many of these developments, for example multi site managment, multi unit development, or multi storey commercial development.</p>
