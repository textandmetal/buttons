											<p>We are looking at infrastructure management or infrasturcture creation as integral to the development process, especially in countries like New Zealand. Whether it is the design and construction of houses, multi unit properties, or commercial buildings, this infrastructure is required to achieve any kind of development. Large scale managenment is involved in many of these developments, for example multi site managment, multi unit development, or multi storey commercial development.</p>
<p>You must remember that every construction project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is unique, in terms of local conditions, the people and equipmet invovled in the construction, and the quality of materials.</li> 
<li>Involves a huge commitment of resources like labour, materials, equipment, finance, and time.</li> 
</ul> 

<p>These project can span several months or over several years, from the start of the project someone has to plan what kind of resources, for example, what kind of equipment will be needed at different point in time as the project progresses. What kind of labour will be required at different points in time? What kind of materias will be needed at diferent stages? What kind of cashflow is needed at different stages?</p>
